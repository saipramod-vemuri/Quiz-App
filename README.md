# Quiz-App
This project lets you become the ultimate quizmaster by building your own engaging quiz app! Variety is key: design fun quizzes with different question types, like multiple choice, true/false, open-ended, and even pictures. Improve front-end development skills while exploring user interaction and data management. Design quizzes that challenge and educate, expanding your own knowledge base.

How it works:

Scoring thatâ€™s fair: Implement dynamic scoring based on how difficult a question is to keep things smooth and balanced. Fuel engagement and competition.
Friendly rivalry: Get people competing with interactive leaderboards where users can track their progress and challenge friends.
Share the fun: Let users spread the quiz love with social sharing features, inviting others to join the learning experience.
Frontend tools:

The basics can be built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the powerhouses of front-end projects.
Adding tools like jQuery or React can add cool interactive elements and dynamic scoring.
Consider using databases like Firebase or localStorage to manage questions, user data, and leaderboards.
